# Analytical Solution of the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetic Equations. 
The present repository contains the MATLAB codes developed to solve the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetic Equations. These codes were developed in the article *A New Solution of the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetics Equations using Symmetry and the Heavisideâ€™s expansion formula*, which was recently submitted to the **Progress in Nuclear Energy** journal.
